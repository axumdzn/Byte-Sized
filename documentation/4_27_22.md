# Daily Stand Up 4/27/22

## Positives
 - Everyone has to work full speed to be able to get everything done that should have been done by today

## Blockers
 - The deadline was that we should be done by midday today, that will absolutely not be happening and its hopeful if we can push
everything before the end of the work day
 - Massive bug stole a lot of Ken't time which is not good
 - Hopeful to have something presentable with working feature files by tomorrow
