# Daily Stand Up 4/22/22

## Positives
 - Ken has recovered somewhat so is able to work at 75% capacity
 - Everyone is now starting to be able to write the front end so progress is being made

## Blockers
 - Ken has a sudden serious family emergency that knocks a lot of his previous progress and prevents him from being able to
use the weekend fully to catch up with work
 - Because of the previous days and the now confusion of how people were doing things has made the group severally behind
 - We also lose thursday to the intervention therefore we are even more behind
