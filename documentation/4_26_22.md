# Daily Stand Up 4/26/22

## Positives
 - Some people are faster than others at some of their responsibilities, so they are given parts that have not been touched yet
leading to decent progress

## Blockers
 - Several errors have cause severe time loss on our sides which we were already short on
 - We have not been able to blend all the files together to work cohesively which we should have been finishing by today to
do the feature files, but I suspect we won't be able to do that at all today either
