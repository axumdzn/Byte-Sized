# Daily Stand Up 4/25/22

## Positives
- Everyone is hard at work trying to get this project done on time
- Ken was able to accomplish some decent work on the weekend which allowed him to catch up a little

## Blockers
 - It is hard to be able to completely finish, some things will have to be skipped or simplified in order to work
 - In order to get a website that works we need a couple more backend functions that were not thought about before we actually
started writing the front end, basically deleting a lot of progress that Ken had done on the weekend
