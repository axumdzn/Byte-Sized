# Daily Stand Up 4/21/22

## Positives
 - We are starting to work on the front end side of things

## Blockers
 - Ken's sickness while was better still incapacitated me for a good part of today leaving me with about half the amount of
time I could have had
 - Wasn't able to set up the system that I wanted to therefore the front end section has become a little bit of chaos
