## Positives
 - Today we have split the project by our features evenly so each person gets 3-4 features to write from top to bottom in the backend
 - So today and tomorrow is mainly aimed at finishing the documentation and testing strategy

## Blockers
 - We are absolutely new to java so some studying is absolutely needed in order to do work
