# Daily Stand Up 4/20/22

## Positives
 - Not much we are not where we should be

## Blockers
 - Everyone is a little more behind than what we should be
 - Ken has personally gotten a severe food poisoning therefore I lost the whole day to code and introduce how the front end was
 supposed to be done
 - As I left earlier than expected the front end may end up as off as earlier
